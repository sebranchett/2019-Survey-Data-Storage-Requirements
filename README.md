# 2019-Survey-Data-Storage-Requirements
From November 2018 to February 2019, the central IT department of the Delft University of Technology ran a survey. This survey set out to discover the research data storage requirements of the TU Delft's academic staff.

This Jupyter Notebook was used to filter the results of the survey for each of the 8 faculties and to create graphs.

The 8 faculties of the TU Delft are:
